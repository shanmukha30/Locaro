## üìÑ Abstract
 We know that after the introduction of e-commerce. India has become one of the leading nations across the world but the current e-commerce sites such as Amazon, Flipkart, etc don't provide equal and ample opportunities to every seller or to the sellers who run their businesses from small-town. Many times the small town vendors are being overshadowed by the big town vendors as they have more resources.
